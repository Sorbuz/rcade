## rcade

This is my first game made with Unity for a school project at Linnaeus University.
The documentation is in swedish, but feel free to simply download the rar-file to try out the game.

The game consists of two minigames, one labyrinth game where you should get to the end without touching the crystals as fast
as possible and one where you should get as much score as possible before you inevitebly lose.

For an executable file, download rcade-build_1.0.rar
